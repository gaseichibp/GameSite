            <h1>Hollow Knight: Silksong</h1>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> is an action-adventure game set in a stylized <em>metroidvania</em> world,
                 featuring an agile and skilled character who has distinct gameplay and her own tools.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Hornet</strong> is faster, jumping and climbing with ease, and has an arsenal of weapons and specialized abilities that
                 allow her to face enemies with a more aggressive and fluid approach. The narrative unfolds in a new region called <strong>Pharloom</strong>,
                  a mysterious place filled with new creatures, varied environments, and challenges that test the player's skill in combat and exploration.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As in <strong>Hollow Knight</strong>, the dark atmosphere and detailed artistic design are fundamental 
                parts of the experience, enriched with a soundtrack that helps create a sense of immersion and mystery. <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> promises to 
                bring renewed mechanics and expand the formula of the first game, with systems like quests that can be accepted and completed for NPCs. Additionally, 
                the game maintains the challenging difficulty, featuring strategic and precise boss battles.</p>
